This project will be using a Python module (tournament.py) that uses a PostgreSQL database 

Included files:

1.The tournament.py: this file is used to provide access to your database via a library of functions which can add, delete or query data in your database to another python program

2.The tournament_test.py Python: this is a client program which will use your functions written in the tournament.py module

3.The tournament.sql file contains the SQL code for the data base
